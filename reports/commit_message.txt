feat(config): Integrate Hydra for flexible configuration management

- Replaced argparse with Hydra for all project settings.
- Created `conf/config.yaml` for centralized configuration of data paths, views, optimization parameters, and mode selection (multi-view/single-view).
- Refactored `fitter_articulation.py` and `data_seaker_video_new.py` to consume settings from the Hydra config object.

feat(preprocess): Add single-view video preprocessing pipeline

- Implemented `preprocess.py` to automatically generate required input data (2D keypoints, silhouette masks, dummy camera parameters) from a single input video.
- Uses OpenCV's background subtraction for mask generation and geometric heuristics for placeholder 2D keypoints.
- Enables running the 3D fitting pipeline on unannotated single-view videos, albeit with limited accuracy for keypoints.

feat(output): Implement OBJ mesh export per frame

- Added functionality to `fitter_articulation.py` to save the final reconstructed 3D mesh as an `.obj` file for each processed frame.
- Output `.obj` files are stored in `mouse_fitting_result/results/obj/`.

docs: Update manual.md with detailed pipeline and usage instructions

- Provided comprehensive documentation on data structures, input/output formats, and step-by-step instructions for both multi-view and single-view modes.

refactor: Update run.sh to reflect Hydra-based execution

- Modified `run.sh` to directly call `python fitter_articulation.py` without explicit arguments, relying on Hydra for configuration.
